DRIVERCOPY (C) 2011 - 2025 Eric Voirin (oerg866@googlemail.com)

DRIVERCOPY is a program written specifically for WIN98QI to recursively scan a directory full of drivers, 
parses its INF files and checks them for validity. It then ppacks their referenced driver files in a CAB archive and copies it
along with the modified INF file into a target directory.

It serves only this purpose in this ecosystem.

As of now the source is a mess (~10 years of code piled up) so I do not feel comfortable sharing it.

The program comes without warranty and can be shared freely in binary form, provided this copyright notice is distributed with it.

I doubt it will be useful.

The source code is available on request (see mail address above).

History:

2025-02-19: Fix CatalogFile entries with nonexistant files causing CAB file creation to fail (fixes ArtX)
2024-10-21: Fix problems with non-unique INF file names causing CAB files to be overwritten and thus missing driver files.
